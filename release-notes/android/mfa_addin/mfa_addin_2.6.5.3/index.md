## Installation

This version of the addin is currently available from the Beta channel in the
MonoDevelop Add-in Manager. The Beta channel is on by default on MonoDevelop, so
you should be able to see the available update in the Add-in Manager. You may
have to refresh the list of updates to see the new version.

If you don't see the update, you can enable the Beta channel by going to the
Gallery panel on the Add-in manager, selecting "Manage Repositories" on the
Repositories dropdown list, checking the "MonoDevelop Add-in Repository (Beta
channel)" entry and then refreshing the addins list by clicking the blue refresh
button on the right side of the Repository dropdown. Once the refresh is
complete, you can update the Mono for Android addin.
