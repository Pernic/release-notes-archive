# Changes Since 0.4.0

* Building on the serialization and rendering improvements in 0.4.0, the REPL
  now features better exploration of all data types. Any object we don't provide
  a special renderer for now expands to an interactive table of member values,
  each of which can itself be expanded.

* Additional interactive rendering improvements:

  - DateTime, number types, enums, and strings have improved rendering.

  - Rendering takes into account the inspected app's CultureInfo.

  - Many types have multiple viewing formats, which can be cycled between by
    clicking the result.

  - [ ![](Images/inspector-0.5.0-vars.gif)](Images/inspector-0.5.0-vars.gif)

  - Exceptions, stdout, and stderr all render more nicely as well.

  - More on the way!

* New "standalone" mode target: iOS (in addition to Mac).

  - Go to `File â†’ New Standalone Session` to launch an Inspector window that
    connects to an agent app we've bundled (like in Sketches).

  - Quick access to a C# REPL in any supported environment.

  - Android and WPF support coming soon!

* Clear the REPL screen with the `clear` command.

* Improved (and interactive!) `GetUsings()` and `GetVars()` built-ins.

* View objects no longer render as images unless you call `Capture(...)` on
  them. This allows deeper view inspection by default.

* Mac view highlighting now works across multiple windows.

* Bugfixes to auto-complete and REPL input history.

* You no longer have to quit the Inspector to access its log files on Windows.

# Known Issues

* When inspecting WPF apps, exceptions may have [missing stack frames][35838].
  This appears to be an issue with the .NET (Microsoft) runtime. iOS, Mac, and
  Android applications are not affected since they use the Mono runtime.

* Inspecting 64-bit WPF apps is not supported (#[37134][37134])
