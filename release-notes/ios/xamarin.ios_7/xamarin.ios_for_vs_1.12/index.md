## Compatibility Notes

-  To use the Xamarin.iOS for Visual Studio Alpha release, you must install the Xamarin.iOS 7.2.2.2, on your build server.
-  If you wish to roll back to the previous Stable, you will need to uninstall this version and re-install the previous stable from scratch.


## Major Changes

-  iOS and Android addins have been merged. This change will fix many compatibility issues that customers had experienced in the past.
