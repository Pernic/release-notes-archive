Xamarin.iOS for Visual Studio 2.0 contains several bug fixes and new features.

## Compatibility Notes

-  To use the Xamarin.iOS for Visual Studio Beta release, you must install the Xamarin.iOS 7.2.3 release on your build server.


## Major Changes

-  iOS and Android addins have been merged. This change will fix many compatibility issues that customers had experienced in the past. Before this change, users were required to install specific corresponding versions of the iOS and Android for VS extensions. When you didnâ€™t, you would be prompted with an unfriendly dialog and, in some cases, some very strange or broken behavior.
-  Allow Setting of an Apple SDK path with the iOS Settings page


## Fixes

-  More responsive detection of iOS devices being plugged in on the Mac host.
