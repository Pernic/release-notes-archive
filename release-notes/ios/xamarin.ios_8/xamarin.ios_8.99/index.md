# Xamarin.iOS 8.99



The Xamarin.iOS 8.99.x series is based on our **upcoming**


	8.12 release and introduces support for Apple's iOS 9.0 APIs.

Our preview versions are designed to rapidly track the changes
	on Apple's iOS 9 betas and have the same limitations and API
	guarantees that a standard Apple iOS beta has. **APIs will change and will be updated continuously as the beta process moves forward**

.## Important Notes



You will need to use Mac OSX 10.10.4 (Yosemite) to run this
	(both because Xcode 7 Beta 6 requires the latest Yosemite service
	release, and because Xamarin's support for El Capitan has not
	been released yet).Apple releases notes contains a list of changes and pending issues for both [iOS 9](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/releasenotes/General/RN-iOSSDK-9.0/index.html)
	and [Xcode 7](https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/Developer_Tools/Xcode_7_beta_6/Xcode_7_beta_6_Release_Notes.pdf)
	that you should review.
