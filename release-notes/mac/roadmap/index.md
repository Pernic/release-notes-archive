# Future Work

We will continue with the usual bug fixing and minor APIs that were missing.

We are planning on bringing more of the MacOS frameworks
	that are not currently bound.

Some of our APIs need additional work improve them to be
	strongly typed and have a more native C# feel. We will
	continue this work, but do not plan on breaking backwards
	compatibility if at all possible.

We will extend our IDE integration.
