Another preview release of the Xamarin Profiler is [available](http://xamarin.com/profiler). Changes since last release
include:


Bugs fixed:

* [44147](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=44147) - Profiler not working with Xcode8 installed
* [44287](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=44287) - Crash on sampling processing
* [44426](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=44426) - Crash on ProfilerAgent


This is a preview release and there are definite limitations, including but not limited to:

* No official support for profiling Release builds
* Data sets are correct at time of collection but data mining and representation is preliminary. This will improve in future releases.
* Time instrument not available for tvOS profiling

We encourage users to get in touch and [file bug reports](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Profiler) so we can continue to make this tool more useful and more stable.
