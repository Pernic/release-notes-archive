The new release is [available](http://xamarin.com/profiler) now for download.

**Release notes**

Windows:

* Updated to support latest XamarinVS


While this is a stable product now, and work is already underway to make the product better as well as
have shiny new features, there are still some known limitations:

* No official support for profiling Release builds
* Time instrument not available for tvOS profiling

We encourage users to get in touch and [file bug reports](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Profiler) so we can continue to make this tool more useful.
