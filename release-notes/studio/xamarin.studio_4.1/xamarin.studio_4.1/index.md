<h2><a name="13" id="13">Xamarin Studio 4.1.13</a></h2>
<h3>Source Code Editing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved support for on-the-fly formatting and indenting.</li>
  <li>Improved source analysis (beta), with better performance, memory use and stability.</li>
  <li>Fixed several issues when editing aspx and xml files.</li>
  <li>Improved handling of files with mixed line endings.</li>
  <li>Improved the look of in-line error bubbles.</li>
  <li>Reloading a modified file from disk and restoring from Autosave are now undo-able actions.</li>
  <li>Fixed issue that caused non-standard keyboards to not work correctly on Windows. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed F# syntax highlighting issues</li>
  <li>Improved the speed and user experience of the import symbol completion</li>
</ul>
<h3>iOS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added right-click context menu on *.xcassets directories to add
individual asset catalogs for images, app icons, and launch images.</li>
  <li>Added an “archive” command for mdtool which does the same thing as the Build / Archive menu item in Xamarin Studio.</li>
  <li>Updated all of the iOS project Storyboard templates to default to the new Xcode 5 format.</li>
  
  <li>Added code completion support for the new Xamarin.iOS protocol
support in C#. Xamarin Studio is now aware of bindings to Objective-C
protocols. This means that when your class implements one of the C#
interfaces that map to an Objective-C protocol, when you use the
“override” keyword it will offer not only to complete the methods
inherited from base classes and interfaces, but will offer also the
optional methods from the Objective-C protocol. More information about the
new protocol support in Xamarin.iOS is available in the <a href="http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/binding_objective-c/binding_objc_libs#Binding_Protocols" target="_blank">Binding Objective-C Libraries document</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3>iOS Designer (Alpha)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Status bar and top bar styles are now correctly handled for iOS 7.</li>
<li>Fixed rendering with iOS 6 appearance on Mavericks.</li>
<li>Handle multiple assemblies with the same name in a project [#15328].</li>
<li>Fix cases where the property panel would not update after changes on the design surface.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that made it difficult to select navigation items and tab bar items.</li>
<li>For custom controls rendered on the design surface, AwakeFromNib will now be called with all the outlets set.</li>
<li>Better support for <code>UINavigationController</code>-based storyboard. Navigation bar and status bar will render correctly for the navigation flow.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Android Designer</h3>The Android Designer is now better in handling
layouts with multiple alternative versions. When opening a layout that
has multiple versions, those are shown as thumbnails in a side bar. The
designer now has two operation modes. In the default mode,
changes done to a layout version are particular to that version and
won’t have any effect on the other versions. When in multi-edit mode,
several layouts can be selected for synchronized editing. Changes done
in one layout will be propagated to all selected layouts. Support for
change conflict resolution when in multi-edit mode has also been
improved.<br>
<br>

make use of properties and environment variables in the definition of
project items.</li>

<li>Dragging/dropping controls when using constraints works correctly again</li>
<li>Added better handling for rare race conditions trying to start the iOS design surface</li>

editable in Xamarin Studio.</li></ul>
