<p style='color:red'>The 4.3.x release series is only available in the Alpha update channel for Mac. The main purpose of this release series is to give a preview of the iOS designer.</p>

<li>Newly generated classes will now contain an IntPtr constructor</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="3" id="3">Xamarin Studio 4.3.2</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Xcode 5.0 is now the minimum supported version of Xcode when using the iOS Designer.</b></li>
<li>Vastly improved experience when designing storyboards in constraint mode.</li>
<li>Added support for asset catalogs inside the design surface.</li>
<li>Images which have both retina and non-retina versions do not show up twice in the image selector.</li>
<li>Improved handling when a property is exported on a class and also on it's super class.</li>

<li>Fixed a regression where UIBarButtonItems could no longer be dropped on UINavigationItems</li>
<li>Custom Controls are now instantiated using their 'IntPtr' constructor instead of the paramterless constructor. This mimics what iOS does at runtime, giving a more consistent experience between the designer and the simulator/device.</li>

	  <img src="Images/2013-11-19_1208.png">
	</li>

	<li>Default constraints should no longer change to 'User' constraints when dragging/dropping.</li>
	<li>Partial support for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1797/_index.html">layout guides</a> although editing support of those constraints is not available in this release.</li>
