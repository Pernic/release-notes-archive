### 0.9.160 changelog


* Bugfix: When query'ing web view elements, where the containing web view is not in origin 0,0, calabash would return a rect where center\_x and center\_y were not in screen coords (e.g. causing touch on that to fail).

* Remove overly verbose log statements, particularly for keyboard\_enter\_text.
