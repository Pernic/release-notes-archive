## 0.9.165 changelog

This is a minor release improving an issue caused by a bug in Apple's UIAutomation when using .typeString

 * https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/269

We attempt a workaround that should improve the situation in many cases. The strategy is to try and save the state of the input field and then retry from that state if a type failure occurs. Change implemented in CalabashScript.
