title: "Xamarin.UITest 0.5.0"
---

* `xut-console.exe` has been renamed to `test-cloud.exe`
* The `Xamarin.UITest.Console` NuGet package has been removed. Everything is (and has been for a while) contained in the `Xamarin.UITest` NuGet package
* `.DeviceIdentifier(...)` can now accept iOS simulator strings for running on a specific simulator. Entering an invalid text produces and error with all the valid options
* Support for `[TestFixtureSetUp]` has been added for Test Cloud
* Android test start up time has been improved
* Direct HTTP access to the test server is available through `.TestServer`
* `.Parent()`, `.Sibling()`, `.Descendant()` and `.Child()` can all accept an integer index for the element - so `.Child(1)` is equivalent to the current `.Child().Index(1)`
* The query language contains `.WebView()` for cross platform web view selection
* The query language has `.InvokeJS(...)` for evaluating JavaScript in matched web views
* Dynamic wait times has been added - currently used for longer default waits in Test Cloud and shorter default waits in the REPL
* `iOSApp` and `IApp` now also have support for `.Back()`
* Android `.EnterText()` has been converted from old `setText` approach to touching the input field and entering text
