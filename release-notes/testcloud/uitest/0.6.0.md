title: "Xamarin.UITest 0.6.0"
---

* Support added for XCode 6 and iOS 8
* Added activation. An api key must be provided in order to run on physical devices or test runs for 15+ minutes
* Added `Back` on iOS apps
* Added `TextField` and `Switch` to the query api
* Added automatic clean-up of test artifacts in the temp folder so they don't grow forever
* Added proper exit codes to `test-cloud.exe` for various error scenarios
* Fixed a bug in `Scroll`
* Changed REPL intellisense to use NRefactory (same as XS) - much better now
* Added the `copy` command in the REPL to copy your command history to clipboard for easy paste into test
* Added the first tab completion shortcuts to REPL. `tap` + (tab) expands to `app.Tap(x => x.`, `query` + (tab) expands to `app.Query(x => x.`
* Improved stability of tests with smarter waiting for both Android and iOS. Should be less need for waits before gestures and screenshots now
* iOS `PanCoordinates` was renamed to `DragCoordinates` and added to the `IApp` interface
