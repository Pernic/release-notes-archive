title: "Xamarin.UITest 0.8.0"
---

* Added short-hand overrides on all query / gesture methods: `Query("MyButton")` is equivalent to `Query(x => x.Marked("MyButton"))`
* App life cycle v1 has been implemented. This allows `StartApp` to be called with `AppDataMode.Clear` or `AppDataMode.DoNotClear`. This works across all platforms Android / iOS running on XTC / local device / local simulator and `AppDataMode.Clear` is default. The only exception is for local iOS devices where `NSUserDefaults` are not cleared. Note that is is a potential BREAKING change, since iOS tests did not reset data before. To maintain this behavior, use `StartApp(AppDataMode.DoNotClear)`. Methods for restarting an app will come soon, but for now, a new call to `StartApp(AppDataMode.DoNotClear)` can be used
* SpecFlow integration has been added. When running SpecFlow locally or in XTC, default is to take a screenshot after each SpecFlow step. Opt out is available on `ConfigureApp` using the `DisableSpecFlowIntegration` method
* Exception handling on other threads has been improved to avoid crashing the Xamarin Studio test runner causing "Unix transport error" RemotingExceptions
* Location simulation is now also available for iOS through `app.Device.SetLocation`
* Test assembly analysis has been moved to the uploader (for chunking) - so we can now also error out if no tests are selected due to included/excluded categories
* Uploader includes assemblies in subfolders from upload
* NuGet package improved with release notes and new icon
* All release notes are now added to: http://developer.xamarin.com/releases/testcloud/uitest/
* Cached test artifacts generation has been improved to be more atomic, should prevent most weird cache problems
* Lots of stability / support / bug fixes
