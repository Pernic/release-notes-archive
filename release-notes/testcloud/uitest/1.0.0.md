* Improved scroll support for Android. Introduces the concept of `ScrollTo` to bring an element on the screen. Also support for specifying which element to scroll, and support for both programmatic (just get me there) and gesture based (simulating user) scroll. Directional scroll methods like `ScrollLeftTo` and `ScrollToVerticalEnd`
* Improved scroll support for iOS, a subset of the API supported by Android. Currently limited to programmatic scroll because a bug in Apple's simulators. 
* Added support for uploading data files to Xamarin Test Cloud using `--data` with test-cloud.exe
* Added `DismissKeyboard` support for Android, renamed iOS `HideKeyboard` to `DismissKeyboard`
* Aligned `app.Invoke` methods to properly throw exceptions when methods are not found
* Colorized and added item indexes to `Query` results in the REPL
* Added support for DSA and EC signed apk files
* Fixed a bug with multi argument iOS `Invoke` invocations
* Added `Index` support for `Css` and `XPath` web view queries
