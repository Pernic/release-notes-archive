* Add simple `DragAndDrop()` to `IApp` and a configurable version to `iOSApp` (`AndroidApp` already has a configurable version).
* Fix issue where incorrect coordinates were being reported for HTML elements on Android 6 devices and which could cause methods such as ScrollTo to fail.
* Grant all permissions when installing an app on Marshmallow. When an application is installed on an M device, all requested permissions are granted when installing.
