* Fixed an issue that occasionally caused even small tests to run for six hours and then complete without results in Test Cloud
* `test-cloud.exe` copes with brief (< 5min) connectivity issues when submitting tests
* `SetSliderValue()` on Android throws exception if the slider element can't be found matching the iOS behaviour
