* [Android] Fixed issue whereby when multiple devices are connected it was not possible to install the apk.
* [iOS] Fix for potential simulator launch failure when there are broken simulators registered (XCode upgrades can create broken duplicate instances of simulators).
* [iOS] Additional operating system popups are automatically dismissed.
* [iOS] Added regex for dismissing security dialogs
* test-cloud.exe no longer processes the --priority option. It still accepts it but pushes a warning message stating that it no longer has any effect.
