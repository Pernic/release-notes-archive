## Breaking Changes
* [iOS] Running iOS tests is only supported on OS-X El Capitan and newer.
* Added `GestureCompletionTimeout` property to `IWaitTimes`.  This can be used to allow slower gestures (e.g. drag) to complete when using a short `GestureWaitTimeout` value.  When adding `GestureCompletionTimeout` values to custom implementations of `IWaitTimes`, using the same value as `GestureWaitTimeout` is likely to be appropriate.

## Improvements
* [iOS] Added support for iOS10, Xcode 8 and OS-X Sierra.
* [iOS] `ClearText()` now works for elements within web views.
* Fix for occasional `SocketException` failures in Test Cloud.
* [iOS] Providing global wait times using `.WaitTimes()` which is part of the `ConfigureApp` class are now honoured in Test Cloud.

## Known Issues
* [iOS] `EnterText()` can occasionally be slow or throw errors.
