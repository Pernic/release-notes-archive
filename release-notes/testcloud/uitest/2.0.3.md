## Improvements

* [iOS] `iOSAppConfigurator.StartApp()` will reuse the running simulator if possible.
* [iOS] Fixed some issues which could cause tests to fail when entering text on iOS 10.  Work is continuing to further improve reliability.
* [iOS] Fixed issue where `PinchToZoomIn()` and `PinchToZoomOut()` zoomed much futher with iOS 10 than in previous versions.
* [Android] Fixed errors when using REPL if an ANDROID_HOME environment variable in the terminal points at an Android SDK incompatible with the Android SDK used by UITest.
* Modified the REPL to work with Mono 4.8 / Xamarin Studio Alpha / Visual Studio for Mac
