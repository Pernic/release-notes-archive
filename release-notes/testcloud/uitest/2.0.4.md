## Improvements

* Added overload of `AppQuery.Id()` which takes an `int id` parameter.  Allows properties of an Android App project's `Resource.Id` to be used in `Id()` queries.
* Fixed issue which caused all test methods to run in XTC when the user specified a specific test using the '--fixture' parameter.
* Fixed issue which caused the REPL to crash when resizing from a larger window to a smaller window.
* [iOS] Fixed issue where `iOSApp.Device.IsSimulator` could be `false` even though the test was running on a simulator.
