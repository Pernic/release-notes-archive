## Improvements

* [iOS] Check for supported version of Xamarin Test Cloud Agent or Calabsh iOS Server.
* [iOS] `iOSApp.ScrollTo()` looks for the `marked` element within each scrollable element on the screen instead of just the fist one. Only one element is scrolled if multiple elements contain the `marked` element.
* [iOS] Touch duration in iOS10 increased to 0.2s to match XCUITest.
* [iOS] Improved reliability of text entry on i386/armv7 devices.
* [iOS] Additional alerts are automatically dismissed on devices set to `nl_BE` and `sv` locales.
