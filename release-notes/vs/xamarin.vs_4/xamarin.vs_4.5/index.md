## Features included in this release:

###  <a id="props"></a>
Property Pages and Manifests redesign

In Xamarin 4.5 we've started a redesign of our Property Pages and Manifest editors. Looking for consistency with Visual Studio itself and Visual Studio for Mac, our new property pages were reorganized and simplified, supporting high-DPI displays. We've also split editors in more natural way. Now you can keep editing csproj options from the Property Pages, and manifest options from the manifest editor.

####  <a id="iosprops"></a>
New iOS Project Property pages

The new iOS property pages provide all the options stored on the csproj file required to build and run the project correctly. It was redesigned in a way it's simpler and effective.

####  <a id="infoplist"></a>
Better iOS Info.plist Manifest Editor

Our iOS Manifest editor (info.plist) was also re-structured. It's now a stand-alone editor, which can be launched by double clicking your info.plist file. It provides a user-friendly UI which can be easily browsed, keeping a familiar look and feel for editting manifests.

It includes editors for Application version, supported orientation, status bar style, Visual Assets, Capabilities like Game Center, Maps integration or Background Modes, as well as advanced features like editting document types, UTIs, and URL Types.

####  <a id="androidprops"></a>
New Android Project Property pages

We've redesigned the Android project options pages! A simplified design with all the options you need.

Known issues

#### Assets Catalog Editor cannot open catalogs named "Assets" in VS2017

The Assets Catalog Editor in Visual Studio 2017 is not be able to open catalogs named "Assets".
This issue affects the default tvOS Assets catalog created as part of the template. The workaround is to delete that "Assets" catalog and create a new one with the default name "Media".

#### Build canceled with error: Project ' *project_name*' requires the following components installed on your machine: ...

Building Android applications can require installing additional components. This can be needed in several cases, like if you're using a new component, NuGet Package, or if it's the first Xamarin.Forms solution you're building on a given machine.

Xamarin for Visual Studio detects the lack of those missing resources, and  shows an error informing it requires to download and install them:

 ![](missingresources.png)

Double click on that error in the list to start downloading and installing the missing components.

Please keep in mind that you need to have Intellisense errors visible in the list, otherwise you won't be able to see that error.

If you try to build any project in the solution without installing the missing components, the build will be canceled. You cannot build without installing those components. Please ensure Intellisense errors are visible to be able to start installing them.

An optional way to install missing components is to build from the command-line.

#### iOS Info.plist Manifest Editor limited Entitlements Support

The new Manifest Editor does not currently support every Entitlement that the previous UI included. Support for more Entitlements in this editor will come in a future release. To add an Entitlement that is not available in the UI yet, right-click on the info.plist file and
choose "Open With". Then, select the "Generic Plist Editor" option. Entitlement keys and values can be added manually in this editor. For a reference of keys and their appropriate values, please visit the [Apple Documentation on Entitlements](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/EntitlementKeyReference/Chapters/AboutEntitlements.html).

#### Other Known issues

Installing Xamarin 4.5 on a machine with only Visual Studio 2013 where Xamarin was never installed before might end up on a broken installation. In such case, no iOS or Android templates are visible, and trying to load Xamarin project results in Xamarin init failure.

If you downgrade to Xamarin 4.2 or older versions after using this release, you will need to re-register your known Mac servers in the Mac Server dialog. Please use the Forget Mac option, and configure your server connection again.
