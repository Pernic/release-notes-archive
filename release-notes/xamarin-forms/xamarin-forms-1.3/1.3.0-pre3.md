## New API
- Device.GetNamedSize (NamedSize size, Type targetType); Same as Device.GetnamedSize (NamedSize size, Element element) but doesn't require an instance.

## Bug Fixes

### Core
- ListView/TableView respect WidthRequest/HeightRequest again (regression in 1.3.0-pre2)
- No longer crash when trying to download/access the same UriImageSource on hundreds of images (System.IOException).
- XAML now properly supports referencing other StaticResources from an Application subclass.
- Fix issue where Grid sometimes measured out taller than it should, especially in ListView/StackLayout. Grid now prefers to expand in the direction of a "defined" constraint, which tends to match expected behavior when measuring. If both constraints are Infinite, previous behavior is retained.
- BindableObject.SetValue will now properly perform loss-less conversions on base types. e.g. Calling slider.SetValue (Slider.ValueProperty, 6.0f) will now work correctly.
- Fix issue where StackLayout in a Horizontal orientation would return an incorrect MinimumHeight in GetSizeRequest.

### iOS
- ImageCell no longer flashes old image on cell re-use.
- Slider now updates bindings correctly due to conversion fix.

### Android
- Label.FontSize = 18 no longer accidentally gives a font size of 14 on any devices.
- Fix another case where ScrollView content could flow outside of bounds (yay).
- Fix crash in WebView when being removed from the visual tree.
- Map no longer re-centers on Layout.


### WinPhone
- Back button now closes ActionSheets and Alerts before attempting Navigation.
- Picker no longer shows a bunch of blank entries.
- ListView selection now properly shows up.
- ListView allows selection of items multiple times in a row if the user calls SelectedItem = null. This behavior matches other platforms correctly now.
- Label now reports the correct minimum width to match other platforms.
